The move is presented as a cultural restoration, not just a political act, and aligns with recent similar renamings like Aurangabad to Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar and Osmanabad to Dharashiv.",

While hybrids are known for better yields and efficient water usage, the real problem, as experts suggest, stems from poor post-harvest handling, such as improper timing of harvest, drying methods, and outdated milling infrastructure. This decision has also stirred controversy as it potentially conflicts with the Seed Act of 1966, which allows the sale of centrally approved hybrid seeds, sparking a debate between state regulations and national agricultural laws.",

Named after Arya Vidyapeeth College, this species stands out for its vivid orange-and-black eyes, unique throat pattern, and rhythmic dusk calls. Although initially mistaken for Leptobrachium smithi, molecular and morphological studies confirmed it as a distinct species.

        "answer": "0.2%",
        "explanation": "The World Trade Organization has projected a 0.2% decline in global merchandise trade for 2025, reflecting heightened trade tensions and increasing uncertainty in global trade policy. This figure contrasts with the 2.9% growth seen in 2024 and underscores a troubling shift driven largely by tariff measures and ongoing disputes, particularly between the US and China. The WTO warns that if these tensions worsen, the contraction could deepen significantly. While global services trade is expected to grow modestly at 4.0%, the slowdown in merchandise trade affects key service sectors like transport and investment. Least-developed countries are especially vulnerable due to their dependence on exports.",

This significant share highlights the state's relatively inclusive industrial environment, especially when compared to other states with low female representation. Tamil Nadu, along with other southern states like Karnataka and Kerala, showcases better gender participation, which is largely driven by industries such as textiles, apparel, and food processing.

This means that the number of inmates far surpasses the official capacity of the prisons, contributing to a host of issues including deteriorating mental and physical health conditions. Overcrowding hampers the delivery of basic healthcare, increases the spread of communicable diseases, and puts additional strain on an already understaffed medical system.

However, the CIT concluded that IEEPA does not give the President unlimited tariff-imposing powers and that such actions lacked legal validity.

With around 140 countries already recognising Palestine, the UK’s conditional support adds to the global diplomatic pressure on Israel while also demonstrating the UK's commitment to human rights, humanitarian relief, and a peaceful resolution to the Middle East conflict.",

This practice causes immense suffering not only to the victims but also to their families and communities. The United Nations General Assembly officially designated August 30 for this observance in 2010, with the aim of promoting accountability, justice, and global awareness of such grave violations.",

        "explanation": "India’s retail inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), stood at 2.07% in August 2025, rising from 1.61% in July. Even with this uptick, the figure remained well below the Reserve Bank of India’s 4% target, offering relief to households and leaving room for accommodative monetary policy. The increase was largely driven by higher prices in categories like vegetables, meat, fish, oil, fats, and personal care, even though food inflation overall remained in deflation for the third straight month. With inflation still comfortably within RBI’s tolerance band, the environment supports economic growth while maintaining price stability.",

        "explanation": "The India Shrimp Tariff Act, introduced by US Senators Bill Cassidy and Cindy Hyde-Smith, aims to protect Louisiana’s shrimp and catfish industries from the impact of cheap shrimp imports from India.

By imposing tariffs, the Act seeks to create a level playing field, ensure fair competition, and safeguard Gulf Coast seafood industries. While this move supports domestic producers, it could also heighten trade tensions between India and the US, potentially leading to disputes at the WTO.",

Despite strong domestic demand, infrastructure investment, and ongoing structural reforms, global trade challenges are likely to dampen India’s expansion.

        "explanation": "The World Bank has upgraded India’s GDP growth forecast for FY26 to 6.5%, up from the earlier estimate of 6.3%.

India is expected to remain the fastest-growing major economy globally, supported by rising consumption, improved agricultural output, and infrastructure spending. Despite these optimistic projections, the World Bank has cautioned about potential risks from global economic uncertainty and external shocks, such as the U.S. tariff on Indian exports.",
